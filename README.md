# Scratch
A lightweight WordPress theme.

##What is Scratch?

Scratch is an extremely lightweight WordPress theme designed for minimalist bloggers.

##Why Scratch?

I created Scratch after tirelessly searching the Internet for a super-thin WordPress theme—to no avail.

##Authors and Contributors

@AdamLawicki authored Scratch in February 2016. It is built on Bootstrap (thanks to @mdo and @fat), and @taniarascia's Start WordPress article.
